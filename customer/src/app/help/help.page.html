    <h2><u>Software Requirements:</u></h2><br>
    <b>Operating systems</b>
    <h2>What is an Operating system:</h2>
    <p>An operating system is software that is used to control and manage the functionality of a computer. It functions
      as an interface for the computer’s hardware components together with some software for a user. This includes
      things like the CPU, RAM, and storage devices. The operating system ensures that each program gets access to the
      resources it needs to run, while also preventing any one program from hogging all the resources and causing the
      system to crash.
      Operating systems come in many different varieties, from Windows and macOS on desktop computers, to Android and
      iOS on mobile devices. Each operating system has its own unique set of features and capabilities, but they all
      share some basic functions.</p>

    <h2>How we set it up:</h2>
    <p>Once we have created and built our application system, we will make use of the most widely used computer
      operating systems, Microsoft Windows or iOS. This will allow almost anyone to make use of the system as our
      application will be compatible with most devices which mainly use either Microsoft Windows or iOS.</p><br />

    <h2>How it will work within the system:</h2>
    <p>Windows devices and Mac devices make use of these operating systems, therefore this will incorporate it with our
      system when it is used. It will support our web application.
      User interface: The user interface allows users to interact with the computer, either through a graphical user
      interface (GUI) or a command-line interface (CLI). The GUI provides a visual interface with icons, windows, and
      menus, while the CLI uses text-based commands to interact with the system
      Device drivers: Device drivers are software components that provide an interface between the operating system and
      hardware devices, such as printers, keyboards etc.. They allow the operating system to communicate with and
      control the hardware devices.
      File system: The file system organises and manages the computer's files and directories. It will allow users and
      our application to access and store data on the computer's storage devices, such as hard drives, solid-state
      drives, or network drives.
      Security features: Operating systems provide various security features to protect the computer and its data. These
      features include user accounts and permissions, firewalls, antivirus software, and encryption tools</p>

    <h2>Why we think this is best:</h2>
    <p>Compatibility:- With a wide range of software applications, making it the best for businesses and individuals who
      want to use our application.
      User-friendly interface:-Windows has a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate, even for users who are
      not familiar with computers.
      Security features: -includes built-in security features, such as antivirus software, a firewall, and regular
      updates.</p><br />


    <b>Coding Frameworks:</b>
    <h2>What is a Framework:</h2>
    <p>A framework is a pre-built software system that provides a set of tools, libraries, and best practices to help
      developers build applications more quickly and efficiently. Frameworks are designed to simplify the development
      process by providing a standardised structure and set of conventions that developers can follow. This makes it
      easier to build complex applications, as developers can focus on the unique aspects of their project, rather than
      spending time on repetitive, boilerplate code. We will be using the following frameworks to build our application:
      Visual Studio 2022, Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 2019 and Angular version 15.</p>
    <h2>How we set it up:</h2>
    <p>In Visual Studio
      We will build our API which will allow our application system to communicate with other applications.(.Net Core
      Web API C#). In this software we will mainly code the functions of our application system. Collecting data,
      storing data, sending messages and so on.
      SQL server
      Will mainly generate and store data into the created database. All operations with data manipulation and
      management will be operated within here. This will work in conjunction with the API thus connecting it to our
      system.
      Angular (v15)
      In order to install angular, we need to follow the following steps:
      Ensure the correct Node.js file has been created and run locally.
      Ensure the correct npm is configured.
      Run the following command in the command terminal:
      “Npm install -g @angular/cli”
      Set the execution policy with the following command to enable PowerShell scripts to run:
      “Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned”</p>

    <p>How it will work within the system:<br/>
    In Visual Studio we will build our API which will allow our application system to communicate with other
      applications.(.Net Core Web API C#). In this software we will mainly code the functions of our application system.
      Collecting data, storing data, sending messages and so on.
      SQL server will mainly generate and store data into the created database. All operations with data manipulation
      and management will be operated within here. This will work in conjunction with the API thus connecting it to our
      system.
      In Visual Studio code, the interfaces of the system application will be designed here. Users will interact with
      what has been created and produced in this software for the application system.
      Why we think this is best:
      Familiarity:- We are well educated with the use of these frameworks therefore developing in these frameworks will
      be sufficient.
      Time-Saving: They provide us with pre-built components and tools that can help speed up the development process,
      saving time and effort.
      Consistency: They help maintain consistency in code structure and organisation, making it </p><br />



    <h2><b>Interface design: TypeScript, Javascript, HTML and CSS</b></h2>
    <p> What is Interface Design:
      User interface (UI) design is the process designers use to build interfaces in software or computerised devices,
      focusing on looks or style. The General screen design of our application makes use of 1.)Typescript, 2.)
      Javascript, 3.)HTML and 4.) CSS. These will be used to develop and design the systems’ user interface as well
      contribute to some functions that may occur. Eg Responsive web design, which enables the responsiveness of the
      websites’ interface to screen size changes. Angular Material and Angular CLI will be used as well.
      How we set it up:<br />
      Typescript will be used within Visual Studio Code to build the application. It will be installed using the npm and
      its files will end with “.ts” Eg.npm install -g typescript
      Javascript files will end with “.js”. Visual Studio Code knows what type of file we will be creating when ending
      the file name with this prefix.
      To use Angular material it will first be installed into our angular project. Eg: “npm install --save
      @angular/material @angular/cdk @angular/animations”. Next the required Angular Material modules will be imported
      into our app module file which is usually named ‘app.module.ts’ The components of Angular Material will be able to
      be used in our app’s templates.
      To use Angular CLI we will run the command “content_copy cd my-app ng serve open”
      How it will work within the system:<br />
      Typescript will be used to support JavaScript features such as async/await, destructuring, and arrow functions.
      Javascript wil be used to add interactivity and animation to web pages, creating dynamic user interfaces, and
      implementing complex features such as form validation, image sliders, and chatbots.
      Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages.
      CSS will be used to style HTML. For responsive web design we make use of Bootstrap, Angular Material and Angular
      CLI to make the web pages responsive. This will increase our users' satisfaction with the use of our application
      system.
      Why we think this is best:<br />
      TypeScript helps catch errors and bugs during development by enforcing strict type checking
      Angular Material offers us reusable and beautiful UI components like Cards, Inputs, Data Tables, Datepickers, and
      much more.</p><br/>

    <h2><b>Responsive Web Design: Bootstrap</b></h2>
    <h2>What is Bootstrap:</h2>
    <p>Bootstrap is the most popular CSS Framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites. It is a
      powerful, extensible, and feature-packed frontend toolkit. Build and customise with Sass, utilise prebuilt grid
      systems and components, and bring projects to life with powerful JavaScript plugins.
      How we set it up:<br />
      When importing Angular and Ionic to our workspace in Visual Studio Code the packages include a link to bootstrap.
      How it will work within the system:<br />
      Bootstrap will allow the user to view the interface in a multitude of screen sizes while keeping the integrity of
      how the overall layout of the interface should look. For example the nav-bar will toggle to a button when in a
      small screen and take up the whole row at the top of a screen when in a larger screen, such as a desktop screen.
      We will be coding in ionic and angular languages on the Visual Studio Code application. We will be using bootstrap
      in combination with CSS to design a responsive and appealing user interface.
      Why we think this is best:<br />
      We think using Bootstrap is best as the team is familiar with coding in this language and have been using it for
      over a year now.
    </p><br />


    <h2><b>Database Access: SQL </b></h2>
    <p>What is SQL:<br />
      Structured Query Language also known as SQL for short is a domain-specific programming language used to manage
      relational databases.
      SQL allows users to interact with a database by providing commands for creating , modifying and querying the data
      that is stored in the database. Its syntax and structure are standardised , making it a universal language for
      working with databases.

      How we set it up:<br />
      We Will open up our Visual Studio and create a new or an existing project.
      In the Solution Explorer , we will right-click on the project name and select “ Add “ followed by “New Item”.
      In the “Add New Item” dialog box , select “Data” and then “ SQL Server Database”
      In the “New SQL Server Database “ dialog box , enter a name for the database that we will use and select a
      location for it.
      We will then Proceed to Click the “Add” button to create the database.
      In the “Server Explorer” window , right-click on the database name and select “Properties”
      In the “Database Properties” dialog box, select the “Connection “ tab.
      Here we will specify the server name , database name , and authentication method for accessing the database.
      We will then proceed to click the “Test Connection” button to verify that the connection is working.
      We will then click the “OK” to close the “Database Properties” dialog box.
      How it will work within the system:<br />
      SQL will allow our client's to add Data into their Database. The Database will hold and store all the information
      relating to the system.
      Why we think this is best:<br />
      SQL has many benefits Such as being easy to learn as well as Scalability as it is able to handle large amounts of
      data without compromising performance.
      SQL also implements strict rules to ensure data integrity as well as offering security features.

    <h2><b>Search Facility:</b></h2>
    <p>
      What is Search Facility:<br />
      A search facility will allow the user to find aspects within the system and help the users to find pages and
      information that they haven't been able to find straight away just by viewing the screens.
      How we set it up:<br />
      We will create a new component or use an existing one that will contain the search functionality.
      We will then define a search term variable in the component class. This will store the value entered by the user
      in the search input field.
      After that we will create an input field in the template where the user can enter the search term. Then we will
      bind this input field to the search term variable using the [(ngModel)] directive.
      Then we will add a filter function to the component class that will filter the list of items based on the search
      term. This function should take the list of items as an input and return a filtered list based on the search term.
      The filtered list will then be binded to the template using the *ngFor directive to display the results.
      We will have to create an extensive list of search options and hints in the list of items for the nav-bar search
      bar.
      How it will work within the system:<br />
      Location of the search facility: <br />The search facility will be located on the header of the page.
      Identify the scope of the search:<br /> Depending on the page the customer is on, they will be able to search a
      list of certain entities. For example: A customer can search for a list of orders they made to be able to track
      their progress in terms of delivery.
      Enter search terms: <br />The customer will type the keywords they want to search for in the search box. To
      generalise the search a user can just type one letter and all items that begin with that specific letter will be
      taken from the database and displayed to the user.
      Review search results:<br /> After entering your search terms, the system will display the results. The user will
      skim through the results to see which ones are relevant to their search. The system will display the results,
      helping the user to quickly determine which ones are relevant.
      Refining the search:<br /> If there are too many results, the user can refine their search by adding more specific
      keywords or using additional search operators.
      Click on the result:<br /> The user will click on the result that they think is relevant to their search to view
      more details.
      Repeat the process:<br /> If the user cannot find what they are looking for, they can refine the search and use
      different keywords.
      Why we think this is best:<br />
      Saves time: A search facility will help us find information quickly and easily, without having to manually go
      through each page or document.It will also enhance our user experience. It will make it easy for users to navigate
      through our system, improving their overall experience. It can also help users find information that they might
      not have been able to find otherwise.

    <h2><b>Exporting from excel: SSIS</b></h2>
    <p>
      What is SSIS:<br />
      Exporting data from a system using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) is a powerful and flexible way to
      transfer data between different sources and destinations. SSIS is a data integration tool that is part of
      Microsoft's SQL Server suite of tools, and it allows you to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data from various
      sources into a destination system.
      How we set it up:<br />
      To export data from a source system using SSIS, we first need to create an SSIS package. This package typically
      contains one or more data flow tasks, which define the data flow from the source system to the destination system.
      Each data flow task contains one or more data flow components, such as sources, transformations, and destinations,
      that perform specific data transformation and manipulation operations.
      To create the SSIS package, we will use SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT), which is a free integrated development
      environment (IDE) for building SSIS packages. Once we have created the package in Visual Studio, we can configure
      the data flow tasks and components according to the system's specific requirements.
      How it will work within the system:<br />
      To export data from a SQL Server database, we will use the SQL Server Source component, which allows us to specify
      the SQL query that selects the data to be exported. We will then use various transformations, i.e., Data
      Conversion/Derived Column transformations, to transform and manipulate the data as needed. Finally, we will use
      the destination component (SQL Server) to write the data to the database.
      Once we have configured the SSIS package, we will deploy it to the SSIS catalog, which is a central repository for
      storing and executing SSIS packages. We can then execute the package manually or schedule it to run at specific
      times using SQL Server Agent, which is a built-in job scheduling and automation tool in SQL Server.
      In this system the client can export product details to an excel sheet. They can choose what tables and attributes
      from the database they would like to export and in what order the columns should be displayed.
      Why we think this is best:<br />
      Overall, exporting data from a system using SSIS is a powerful and flexible way to transfer data between different
      sources and destinations and it is already available in Visual Studio, which is one of the applications we will be
      using to create our system. With its rich set of data flow components and transformations, SSIS allows us to
      manipulate and transform data in many ways, and its scheduling and automation features make it easy to run the
      data export process on a regular basis.

      When we sign up with payfast we will specify what credentials we will be passing to and from our system. In our
      angular application we will submit the customers order details as form data.
      How it will work within the system:<br />
      By using the payfast link that we can add to our own code , we will pass through the invoice id, and price of the
      order from the Invoice table as well as the name, email and cell phone number of the customer from the customer
      table. We will then create a unique security signature that will be passed as a hidden input and send the customer
      to PayFast for payment.
      Once a payment has been successfully completed Payfast will then return the payfast unique ID, payment ID and
      payment status to the Payment table, invoice ID to the invoice table and the order id and order status to the
      Order table.
      Why we think this is best:<br />
      Overall, integrating PayFast into your system can provide a secure and convenient payment processing solution for
      your customers, which can help to increase customer satisfaction and streamline your business operations.
      Payfast also only charges transaction fees, which means that the client only has to pay small fees relating to
      each purchase.

      extensible, and feature-packed frontend toolkit. Build and customize with Sass, utilize prebuilt grid systems and
      components, and bring projects to life with powerful JavaScript plugins.
      How we set it up:<br />
      In order to create a mobile app with dynamic views we will be writing our system in angular and ionic language
      using bootstrap to create a responsive design. We will be using Visual Studio Code to code our front end which
      will dynamically access our API’s and database.
      How it will work within the system:<br />
      The ionic application will allow us to create a mobile application for the customer. Because Ionic code is written
      in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern we are able to
      access and update the database.
      It also utilizes Angular's two-way data binding and dependency injection features to simplify code development and
      maintenance.
      Why we think this is best:<br />
      In summary, Ionic code is a robust, versatile, and easy-to-use framework for developing cross-platform mobile and
      web applications using web technologies. Its wide range of pre-built components, powerful CLI, and native device
      access features make it an excellent choice for building high-quality mobile applications.

    <h2><b>Data layer:</b></h2>
    <p>
      What is a data layer:<br />
      In a system that uses API .NET Core and Angular workspace, a data layer plays a crucial role in managing the data
      flow between the client-side Angular application and the server-side .NET Core API. The data layer is a design
      pattern that separates the data access logic from the rest of the application, making it easier to manage and
      maintain data-related code.
      How we set it up:<br />
      To implement a data layer in a system that uses API .NET Core and Angular workspace, you can create a separate
      project for the data access logic. This project can include models for data entities, data access code using
      Entity Framework, caching code, and other related functionality. You can then use dependency injection to inject
      the data layer into your Angular service or .NET Core controller as needed.
      How it will work within the system:
      Abstraction of data access: <br />
      With a data layer, we can abstract the data access logic from the rest of the application. This means that the
      Angular application can interact with the data layer without worrying about the underlying data storage
      technology. The data layer can handle the specifics of interacting with the database, caching data, and other
      related tasks.
      Improved maintainability: <br />
      By separating data access logic into a separate layer, we can make the code easier to maintain and debug. Changes
      to the data access logic can be made in one place, without affecting the rest of the application. This makes it
      easier to test and update the application over time.
      Reduced duplication of code: <br />
      With a data layer, we can reuse data access code across multiple parts of the application. This can save
      development time and reduce the likelihood of errors in the code. The data layer can also help with code
      organisation, making it easier to find and reuse code.
      Improved performance: <br />
      By using a data layer, we can implement caching and other performance optimizations. The data layer can cache
      frequently accessed data, reducing the number of database queries needed to retrieve the data.

      Why we think this is best:<br />
      Overall, using a data layer in a system that uses API .NET Core and Angular workspace can improve maintainability,
      reduce duplication of code, and improve performance. By abstracting data access logic into a separate layer, you
      can make the application easier to manage and maintain over time
